    "# Explore Country Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you to explore some of raw health data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development ([OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics_health-data-en)) for the countries/regions in the Commonwealth studies. Unfortunately, Taiwain and Singapore are not included in their data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "While an incredibly rich data resource, I found myself continually frustrated when I tried to use the OECD [API (application program interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to programmatically pull the data. This cost me a lot of time, and so I've fallen back on using a subset of the data that I've downloaded previously. Of course all of the data can be explored more fully at the [stats.oecd.org](https://stats.oecd.org/) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the cell with `get_case_explorer()` it will bring up two dropdown menus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Countries__: Select which countries you want to look at. (You can select multiple countries)\n",
    "- __Data Set__: Select which data set you want to look at. (You can only view one data set at a time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be sorted by column. I found it most useful to sort by `Variable` (`Indicator` for the `Health Care Quality Indicators` data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the table isn't drawn until you select/change one of the dropdown menus (didn't get a chance to debug this).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a wide variety in the amount/types of data available for each country."
